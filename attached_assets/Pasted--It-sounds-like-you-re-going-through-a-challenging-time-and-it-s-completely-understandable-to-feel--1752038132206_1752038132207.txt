It sounds like you're going through a challenging time, and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when work pressure builds up. It's really proactive of you to seek out ways to manage your stress!

While I can't give medical advice, I can share some general wellness strategies that many people find helpful for managing stress. Remember, what works for one person might be different for another, so it's about finding what resonates with you.

Here are a few common stress management techniques you might consider:

1. **Mindfulness and Deep Breathing:**
* **Short breaks:** Even a few minutes of focusing on your breath can make a difference. Try inhaling slowly through your nose, holding for a few seconds, and exhaling slowly through your mouth.
* **Mindful moments:** Pay attention to your senses during everyday activities, like really tasting your food or feeling the water while washing your hands. This helps ground you in the present.
* **Apps:** There are many free apps (like Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer) that offer guided meditations and breathing exercises.

2. **Physical Activity:**
* Even a short walk during your lunch break can help clear your head and release endorphins, which are natural mood boosters.
* Find something you enjoy, whether it's yoga, dancing, cycling, or just stretching. Consistency is more important than intensity.

3. **Time Management and Boundaries:**
* **Prioritize:** Identify your most important tasks and focus on them first. Breaking large tasks into smaller, manageable steps can make them feel less daunting.
* **Learn to say "no":** It's okay to decline extra responsibilities if you're already feeling overloaded. Setting healthy boundaries protects your time and energy.
* **Take regular breaks:** Stepping away from your desk, even for 5-10 minutes every hour or two, can help prevent burnout.

4. **Connect with Others:**
* Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or colleague about how you're feeling can provide support and perspective.
* Social connection is a powerful buffer against stress.

5. **Healthy Lifestyle Foundations:**
* **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Lack of sleep can significantly worsen stress.
* **Nutrition:** Eating balanced meals can help stabilize your energy levels and mood.
* **Limit stimulants:** Be mindful of excessive caffeine or sugar, which can sometimes heighten feelings of anxiety.

6. **Engage in Hobbies/Relaxation:**
* Make time for activities you enjoy outside of work, whether it's reading, listening to music, gardening, or creative pursuits. These can be powerful stress reducers.

Taking the first step to address how you're feeling is a big one, and I hope some of these suggestions help you find a bit more balance and peace.
