<role>
You are an expert in Web Speech API implementation with deep knowledge of voice activity detection and continuous speech recognition patterns.
</role>

<task>
Fix the speech-to-text implementation to support continuous recording until the user manually stops, eliminating automatic cutoffs from built-in VAD.
</task>

<context>
The current implementation uses Web Speech API but automatically cuts off recording due to VAD detecting pauses. Users need to speak continuously without automatic interruption, similar to voice memo apps.
</context>

<current_problem>
- Web Speech API SpeechRecognition stops recording on short pauses
- Users get cut off mid-sentence when they pause to think
- No semantic understanding of when the user is actually done speaking
- Need continuous recording until user manually stops
</current_problem>

<specific_fixes_needed>
**1. Configure SpeechRecognition settings:**
- Set `continuous = true` for ongoing recognition
- Set `interimResults = true` to show real-time transcription
- Implement `onresult` handler to capture partial and final results
- Use `onend` handler to automatically restart recognition

**2. Implement continuous recording loop:**
- Automatically restart recognition when it stops due to timeout
- Accumulate transcribed text across multiple recognition sessions
- Provide manual "Stop Recording" button for user control

**3. Visual feedback improvements:**
- Show "Recording..." indicator while active
- Display interim results in real-time
- Clear indication of when recording has stopped
</specific_fixes_needed>

<implementation_approach>
```javascript
// Key configuration example
recognition.continuous = true;
recognition.interimResults = true;
recognition.maxAlternatives = 1;

// Auto-restart on end
recognition.onend = function() {
  if (isRecording) {
    recognition.start(); // Restart if still recording
  }
};
</implementation_approach>
<output_format>
Updated React component with:

Properly configured SpeechRecognition settings
Continuous recording that doesn't auto-stop
Manual start/stop controls
Real-time transcript display
Accumulated text across recognition sessions
</output_format>

<constraints>
- Focus specifically on fixing the VAD/turn detection issue
- Don't add new features - just fix the continuous recording problem
- Include error handling for recognition failures
- Provide clear user feedback about recording state
- If continuous mode has issues, implement restart-on-end pattern as fallback
</constraints>
